				<p>My name is Ezra Snow, sometimes known as LightSaber236 online. I live in North Carolina, and I'm homeschooled, which will probably explain some things you might see on here. I'm super into computers, and I also enjoy playing games on them in my free time. My favorite color is blue, which you probably noticed from the large amounts of it on this website.</p>
				<p>I want to be a software developer/IT person when I grow up. I actually wrote most of this website from scratch in HTML/CSS (not to brag or anything...). I also like messing with Windows and seeing what carnage goes on inside it. IMO, the Windows 7 UI is peak UI design, so my computer has the Windows 7 UI on it, but runs Windows 10. (It can't officially run Windows 11, since it's kind of old.)</p>

					<p>This is a nearly 10 year old Dell OptiPlex that I got from my dad's workplace for free, along with the monitor and keyboard pictured. In a former life, that OptiPlex was a humble office computer, but I bought a graphics card, a better CPU, and a few other components to turn it into a better gaming computer than the 12-year old not-gaming laptop I was using before.</p>
					<p><i>To those who consider this computer unusable for anything beyond light web browsing:</i> You don't necessarily need to spend $1000's to get a powerful computer. Also, I was coming from an ancient laptop that really was basically unusable for much beyond web browsing and basic office work. I still did my best to game on it, and it did its best. But the 4th gen Core i7 and the RX 6400 in this OptiPlex blow that laptop completely out of the water, and for now serve me <i>just fine</i>. Anything more powerful than that is overkill for me right now. Probably in a couple years, I'll need a better computer, but for now this works great for me.</p>
